# Azure Avenue - Laravel E-Commerce Store

Azure Avenue is a basic online store built with Laravel, serving as a comprehensive final project for my Laravel training. It showcases the fundamental features of an e-commerce platform, allowing users to browse and purchase products conveniently.

- Product Catalog: Users can explore a wide range of products organized into categories. Each product listing provides details such as title, description, price, and images.
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts and login. Authentication ensures secure access to purchased products.
